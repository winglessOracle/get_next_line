# get_next_line
get_next_line is a CODAM assignment (part of 42 network).
This assigment is to write a function that returns a line 
read from a file descriptor.
Repeated calls (e.g., using a loop) to your get_next_line() 
function should let you read the text file pointed to by
the file descriptor, one line at a time.
The function should return the line that was read.
If there is nothing else to read or if an error occurred,
it should return NULL. Additionally the buffer size
must be set at a default value and modifialbe through the
command line (e.g. -D BUFFER_SIZE=42).
